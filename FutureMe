Notes ont the project:

Imagine someone has given you a baby Einstein and told you:
He doesnt cry, only needs one type of food and you can teach him absolutely anything( but you've got to break it down into simple instructions).
There is only one thing wrong with him: right now he doesnt know anything
Writing computer programs is a little bit like teaching that child. Machines are the stupidest things in the world, and yet its easy to teach them because they are crazy fast and precise.
